# Game-Of-Life--Project-Using-2D-Arrays-and-Union-Find

**First assignment of my data structures class, where we manipulated a grid using 2D arrays and quick union**

Conway Game of Life is a cellular discrete model of computation devised by John Horton Conway. The game consists of a game board (grid) of n x m cells, each in one of two states, alive or dead.

The game starts with an initial pattern, then it will change what cells are alive or dead from one generation to the next depending on a set of rules. As the Game of Life continues, the game will keep making a new generation (based on the preceding one) until it reaches one of three states.
